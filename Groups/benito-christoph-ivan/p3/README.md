# P3 - RL (Benito, Christoph, Ivan)

## Instructions

Goals:

> - Apply Reinforcement Learning to a realistic scenario (Self-Repair System)
> - Learn how to use the OpenAI Gym interface 
> - Apply the Hidden Markov Model to incorporate partial observability in decision making
>   - Substitute the static transition matrix for the ones that you learned in Project-2
> - Compare RL algorithms
> - Evaluation Convergence Charts produced for
>   - Different failure patterns
>   - Different HMM transition matrices

Chosen project:

> Reproduce the famous Sutton&Barton cliff maze 

## Solution

See implementation and top comment in `p3.py`.
